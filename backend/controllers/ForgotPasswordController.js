/**
 * Forgot password route handler.
 *
 * This endpoint will initiate the password recovery process once the logic is implemented.
 * Expected steps include validating the userâ€™s email, generating a secure reset token,
 * saving the token with expiration, and sending a password reset email to the user.
 *
 * Note: This is currently a placeholder and does not perform any recovery logic.
 *
 * @param {import('express').Request} req - Express request object, expected to contain the user's email in the body.
 * @param {import('express').Response} res - Express response object, used to send status and messages back to the client.
 * @returns {void} Sends a response indicating the route is active.

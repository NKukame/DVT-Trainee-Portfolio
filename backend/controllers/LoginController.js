/**
 * Login route handler.
 *
 * This endpoint will handle user authentication once the logic is implemented.
 * It will validate user credentials (e.g., email and password) sent in the request body,
 * authenticate the user against the database, and return a JWT token.
 *
 * Note: This is currently a placeholder and does not perform any authentication.
 *
 * @param {import('express').Request} req - Express request object, expected to contain user credentials in the body.
 * @param {import('express').Response} res - Express response object, used to send status and data back to the client.
 * @returns {void} Sends a response indicating the route is active.
